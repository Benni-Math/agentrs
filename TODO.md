# TODO

 - Plan out API
   - Model, Agent, Experiment, Sample, Network, etc.
   - polars? rust-numpy?
 - write tests
   - https://github.com/cjermain/rust-python-coverage
 - rough draft
   - follow along with ECS type projects?
 - benchmark against agentpy
   - create overlay to pull in
   - use pytest and pytest-benchmark
 - optimize (ndarray, rust-numpy, blas, lapack?)
 - add differential evolution as well (and other optimization methods?)
 - make it easy to create the `docker compose` setup for 'deployment'


At some point:
 - integrate with dentalcaries
 - integrate with CERDA
