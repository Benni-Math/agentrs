# Agent-Base Modelling

Start making your agent-based model!

To start development, try `nix develop .` - to keep your shell use the `--command` options. For example, if you use `zsh`, try `nix develop . --command zsh`.

From there, you can use Jupyter Notebook to test and prototype, and then package your experiments as Docker containers use `just zip-exp`.
